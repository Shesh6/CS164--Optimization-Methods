Assume that the ends of the chain are anchored at two points along the $x$ axis, namely $âˆ’w/2$ and $w/2$, with $Nl > w$. The chain hangs downwards under gravity. We will number the chain segments from $i = 1 . . . N$, denoting the $y$ coordinate of the left-hand edge of each link by $y_i$. We will define a height $y_{N+1} = 0$ for convenience. Finally, we will denote the angle of each segment from the horizontal as $\\theta_i$._"
