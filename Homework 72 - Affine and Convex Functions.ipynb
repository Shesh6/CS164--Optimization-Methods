Since a convex set contains the line segments connecting any of its members, no segment of the function between any two members will take any value other than 0, showing us that the function is piecewise continuous with three sections. For each pair of points, if the points are both memebers of the set or both aren't memebrs of the set, the line segment connecting them is always equal in value to the function segment connecting them. For pairs of points where one is a memeber of the set and the other isn't, then multiplication by any $\\lambda < 1$ will never matter, and the line segment connecting the pair is always above the function segment connecting them. Therefore, the function is convex."

The only sublevel set in the reals is the middle one, where the values are all 0, which corresponds to the inputs that are in $\\mathcal{X}$. Therefore, if $\\mathcal{X}$ is closed, the sublevel set is closed, and the function is closed.\n"
